# Arise challenge algorithm template


## Description

This repository contains a template for creating and submitting an algorithm to the Arise Challenge.

The included scripts will build a docker image and bundle it into a compressed file, which can then be uploaded via the challenge platform user interface.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). It is available for all major operating systems.

## Usage

Add you algorithm's implementation in `main.py`. When you are ready to submit your algorithm, it can be exported with one of the methods listed below.

Your algorithm implementation starts in the `predict` function, right after `inputs = list(inputs)` (See [here](main.py#L9)). It should return a list of values grouped by the given columns, as listed in `def mapping_to_csv()`.


For example: a prediction for an image from input (algorithm only gets one image at a time), predicted at `level_0` as `"Animalia"` with confidence `1.0`:
```py
values["image_uid"] = [Path(input).stem]
values["level_0"] =  ["Animalia"]
values["level_0_probability"] =  [1.0]
```

### Adding additional files
**NOTE**: Adding files to the container needs to happen in (potentially) two places: the Dockerfile has a line which should copy everything into the container from the current directory: `COPY --chown=user:user . /opt/app/`, the `.` means everything in this directory, but first docker checks what files is it allowed to look for in the  `.dockerignore` file. Opening up `.dockerignore`, you may notice that our current setup disregards everything with the star symbol `*`, and newline by newline enables just a few files with the `!` mark.
> 
> **EXAMPLE**: you want to add the weights which are named `weights.pkl`, you need to allow it in `.dockerignore`: `! weights.pkl` 

## Testing

The folder `./example/input` contains an example input image. The expected prediction for this image can be found in `./example/output/expected_predictions.csv`.
To test if your algorithm produces what you expect, change the values in `./example/output/expected_predictions.csv` to your expected outputs, then run:
```sh
./scripts/docker-test.sh
```

On success, you should see the text `Tests successfully passed...`.

## Exporting on Windows / Mac

From this directory launch a terminal / command prompt / powershell, then:
```cmd
docker run -v .:/app --workdir=/app --privileged --name dind docker:24.0.9-dind
```

Go to Docker Desktop and in the containers there should be `dind`, and on the three dots, it should appear `Open in terminal` then run `./scripts/docker-export.sh`.

This will create diopsis_class_alg.tar.gz which can be uploaded via the challenge platform.

## Exporting on Linux

We provide various ways to export your algorithm:
- `./scripts/docker-export.sh` (you will need to have a Docker version 24 or lower, check with `docker -v`)
- `./scripts/podman-export.sh` (need podman installed `sudo apt install podman`)
- `./scripts/docker24-shell.sh` (when your docker version is higher than 24)
    - to work with this, after you run it you get a shell, and inside the shell run `./scripts/docker-export.sh`
